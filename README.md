Project Name: Home Base

Description: A virtual homeownerâ€™s manual to hold information about consumables for a home which sends text and email reminders with links to purchase items needed. To limit the project we will focus on HVAC air filter replacement since it is common to almost all houses but is easily forgotten. The program will take and store air filter size information, issue text and email reminders at set intervals, and allow different levels of access to different users via registration and login.

Base Feature List
User Account Creation and Management: User can create accounts - admins can edit information while regular users cannot
Full CRUD Functionality:  Admins can save, edit, and delete filter size information. Regular users can read.
Relational Database: Filter size information stored in a MySQL database
External API Usage: Amazon Price and Twilio

Projected Tech Stack
React for front end
Java and Spring for back end
MySQL for database
Amazon Price for item link and Twilio for text/email reminders
